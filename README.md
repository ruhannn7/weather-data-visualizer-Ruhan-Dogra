# weather-data-visualizer-Ruhan-Dogra
Project Overview

This repository contains the solution for the "Data Analysis and Visualization with Real-World Weather Data" mini-project. The objective is to apply core data science skills—data acquisition, cleaning, statistical analysis, and time-series aggregation—using Python's powerful data manipulation libraries.

The final outputs include cleaned data, detailed daily and monthly statistical summaries, and a final report explaining the findings.

🛠️ Tools and Technologies Used

Python: Primary programming language.

Pandas: Used extensively for data loading, cleaning, time-series resampling (daily/monthly aggregation), and data export.

NumPy: Used implicitly by Pandas for efficient numerical operations (calculating mean, min, max, and standard deviation).
